<p><b>System requirements</b></p>

<p>This requires Android 4.0 or better. I've tested this successfully on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Asus Nexus 7 (2013),
running Android 4.3. The auto-stabilise feature may not be available if the app deems there is not enough memory (RAM) available
(technical explanation: requires 128MB of "large heap").</p>

<p><b>Quickstart</b></p>

<p>Simply point, and press the blue camera icon <img src="take_photo.png" width="32" height="32"> to take a photo.
The camera will automatically focus before taking the picture. You can also focus at any time by touching on the screen. If
your device supports focus areas, you can touch the part of the screen you want to focus. Touching an area will also
(if your device supports it) control the exposure level (e.g., so clicking on a bright area will adjust the exposure
so that it becomes less bright). To zoom, either
press use the zoom "-" and "+" control buttons, use the slider next to those buttons, or do a multi-touch "pinch"
gesture. You can also control via the volume keys on
your phone or tablet - by default, pressing them will take a photo, but can change this to zoom in/out from the
<a href="#settings">Settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can press the gallery icon to view your photos
(by default saved in the OpenCamera folder) - it will show the most recent image or video. The gallery button's
icon will also show a thumbnail for the most recent image/video. Note that there is also an option
in the <a href="#settings">Settings</a> to "Pause after taking photo" - if ticked,
then when you take a photo, the image will be displayed - to keep the photo, touch the screen (or take another photo). To delete it,
press the trash icon <img src="trash.png" width="32" height="32">. To share an image, press the share icon
<img src="share.png" width="32" height="32">.</p>

<p>The screen display is kept on when Open Camera is running as the foreground app (if
you want to switch off the display, do so on your device manually).</p>

<p><b>On-Screen User Interface</b></p>

<p>A white square is shown (depending on the focus mode), which turns green to indicate that the auto-focus was
successful, or red if it was not.</p>

<p><img src="switch_camera.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch camera</b> - Switches between front and back camera (if your
device has two cameras).</p>

<p><img src="switch_video.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch to/from video</b> - Switches between taking photo mode, and
recording video mode. When in video mode, the take photo icon will change to the record video icon
<img src="take_video.png" width="32" height="32">.</p>

<p><img src="flash_auto.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Flash mode</b> - Click this to cycle through the available flash modes. Popup
text will explain what each mode is. (Only available if the camera supports flash.)</p>

<p><img src="focus_mode_auto.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Focus mode</b> - Click this to cycle through the available focus modes.
Popup text will explain what each mode is. (Only available if the camera supports different focus modes.)</p>

<p><img src="exposure.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Exposure compensation</b> - Clicking this will bring up a
slider and plus/minus buttons which can be used to control the exposure compensation. A higher value increases
the exposure, so that pictures come out brighter in low light; a lower value makes pictures darker. Set to 0 for
the default exposure. To get rid of the slider and buttons, either click the Exposure button again, or click
elsewhere on the screen. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">Exposure compensation</a>.
(Only available if the camera supports control of the exposure.)</p>

<p><b>Gallery</b> - Click to launch the Gallery app, to view the most recent
photo/video (by default saved in the OpenCamera folder). If you get the message "No Gallery app available", then you should install
a Gallery app (e.g., <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moblynx.galleryics">Gallery ICS</a>).</p>

<p><img src="settings.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Settings</b> - Click to open the <a href="#settings">Settings</a>. (If your phone/tablet
has a hardware menu button, pressing that should also open the settings.)</p>

<p>The on-screen display also shows the remaining battery left (green/red status bar in the corner), and optionally
the zoom level (if zoomed in), the remaining free storage space on the device, and the current angle orientation
of the camera. If "Store location data" is enabled (off by default), then a small "earth" icon
<img src="earth.png" width="24" height="24"> will appear next to
the battery indicator when the location is available (you can still take photos when the earth icon doesn't show,
it's just that location data won't be stored in the photo). A dot shows to the top-right of the earth icon to
indicate the accuracy (green for accurate, yellow for less accurate). If the location isn't available, a red dash will be shown through the earth icon.</p>

<p><a name="auto_stabilise"><b>Auto-stabilise feature</b></p>

<p>All Android cameras will rotate the photo depending on the orientation of the camera, but only to the nearest 90 degrees - so the
photos look right whether you hold the device in "portrait" or "landscape" mode. But Open Camera has the option to rotate the
photos so they are perfectly level, so your shots come out looking perfectly level every time!</p>

<p><img src="auto_stabilise_image_20131009.jpg" title="Screenshots demonstrating auto-stabilise"></p>

<p>The above shows a rather exaggerated example - in practice, you can probably take better photos, but this feature ensures they
come out perfectly level, without you having to edit them afterwards in a photo editor. Of course you won't always want this -
perhaps you're going for artistic 45-degree shots - so this is an option. By default it is disabled.  To enable, go to the
<a href="#settings">Settings</a>, and enable "Auto-stabilise". Note that this feature is memory intensive - it will not be available
on devices with low memory. Even where it is available, the performance of taking photos will be
slower, and there is a risk it may cause the app to fail on devices I haven't been able
to test. If you do have problems, you'll have to disable the feature again.</p>

<p>Also note that the feature reduces the available space in the image - because rotating an image makes it no longer fit into a
rectangular image, so we have to crop it. So it's still advisable to try to hold the camera reasonably level when using this
feature.</p>

<p><a name="settings"><b>Settings</b></p>

<p><b>Camera Effects:</b></p>

<p><b>Auto-stabilise</b> - Enable the auto-stabilise features for photos (see <a href="#auto_stabilise">above</a>). (Only available
if the device has enough memory.)</p>

<p><b>Apply a color effect</b> - Choose a color effect to apply. (Only available if the camera supports color effects.)</p>

<p><b>Apply a scene mode</b> - Choose a scene mode to apply. (Only available if the camera supports scene modes.)</p>

<p><b>Set the white balance</b> - Choose a method to control how the white balance is set. See
<a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance">here</a> for an explanation of white balance. (Only
available if the camera supports different white balance settings.)</p>

<!--<p><b>Set the exposure compensation</b> - A higher value increases the exposure,
so that pictures come out brighter in low light; a lower value makes pictures
darker. Set to 0 for the default exposure. See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">Exposure compensation</a>.
(Only available if the camera supports control of the exposure.)</p>-->

<p><b>Face detection</b> - If this is enabled, then the camera will automatically try to detect faces, and use
them for the focus, metering (exposure) and white balance. Faces will be drawn as yellow squares when detected.
Note that if this option is enabled, then you will not be able to touch to manually select the focus area, and
the white balance option will have no effect (since the face recognition will be used to determine these).</p>

<p><b>Camera Controls:</b></p>

<p><b>Timer</b> - Set a timer for taking photos or recording video.</p>

<p><b>Timer beep</b> - Whether to beep when the timer is counting down, or for the burst mode delay (see below).</p>

<p><b>Burst mode</b> - Take a repeated set of photos when the camera button is pressed.</p>

<p><b>Burst mode interval</b> - Specify the delay (if any) between photos in burst mode. Note that if no delay is
selected, the actual speed that the photos are taken at will depend on the performance of your device's camera. If
a delay is selected, note that this does not include the time taken to auto-focus and take each photo.</p>

<p><b>More camera controls</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Preview size</b> - By default, Open Camera makes the camera preview (the image that is displayed on the
phone/tablet's display) as large as possible, trying to fill the available space. However if the resolution of the
photo/video is a different aspect ratio to that of your device, this will result in the preview being cropped. If
instead you select "Match photo/video size (WYSIWYG)", then the aspect ratio of the preview will match that of the
photo/video resolution. The advantage is that what you see in the preview will match what will be in the resultant
photo or video ("What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get") - though this may mean you will have "black bars" on the display in
order to do this.</p>

<p><b>Pause after taking photo</b> - If ticked, after taking a photo the display will pause, with options to share or delete the
photo. To keep the photo and continue, touch the screen (or take another photo).</p>

<p><b>Shutter sound</b> - Whether to play a sound after taking a photo. (Requires Android 4.2 or higher to disable.)</p>

<p><b>Volume keys</b> - You can set what happens when the volume keys are pressed: either take photo/video, zoom in/out,
change the exposure compensation, or just change the device's volume as normal.</p>

<p><b>Save location</b> - Enter the folder to store the photos in. This can be either a relative path (e.g.,
OpenCamera or even something like MyPics/Camera) in which case the folder will be located inside the "DCIM"
folder (usually something like /sdcard/DCIM/ ). For more advanced users, if the folder name starts with "/", then
it indicates the full absolute path (e.g., /sdcard/Pictures/Photos ). Note that folder names are case sensitive.
OpenCamera will attempt to create the folder (and any sub-folders as required) if it doesn't exist. If you specify
a path that you don't have write permissions for, then OpenCamera will fail to save images/videos (and this will
be reported when you try to take a photo or video).
You can also use this option to save to an external SD card, though unfortunately the path varies depending on the
device, so you'll have to look this up yourself (it's usually something inside /mnt/ - a file explorer app such as
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop">ES File Explorer</a> may help).</p>

<p><b>UI placement</b> - Whether to optimise the user interface for left-handed or right-handed use.</p>

<p><b>Show zoom</b> - Whether to display the current zoom level of the camera (when zoomed in).</p>

<p><b>Show free memory</b> - Whether to display the remaining storage space of the device.</p>

<p><b>Show angle</b> - Whether to display the orientation angle of the device's camera.</p>

<p><b>Show angle line</b> - Whether to display a horizontal "level" line that visually indicates the orientation of the device.</p>

<p><b>Show compass direction</b> - Whether to display the compass direction of the device's camera.</p>

<p><b>Show a grid</b> - Whether to display one of a choice of grids on the camera preview (including 3x3 grid,
which helps with applying the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>).</p>

<p><b>Show thumbnail animation</b> - Whether to display the moving thumbnail animation when taking a photo.</p>

<p><b>Force maximum brightness</b> - Whether to force the screen display to maximum brightness.</p>

<p><b>Photo and Video Settings:</b></p>

<p><b>Photo and video settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Camera resolution</b> - Select the resolution of photo images taken by the camera. Note that if auto-stabilise is enabled,
images will in general come out as a slightly lower resolution (due to the rotation and cropping that's required).</p>

<p><b>Image quality</b> - The image quality of saved JPEG images. Higher means better quality, but the image files will take up
more storage space.</p>

<p><b>Store location data (Geotagging)</b> - If selected, then photos will be tagged with the current location, and compass direction.</p>

<p><b>Video resolution</b> - Select the resolution of videos taken by the camera.</p>

<p><b>Record audio</b> - Whether to record audio when recording a video.</p>

<p><b>Audio source</b> - Select the audio source for recording video. The effect of this depends on your device -
if it supports an external microphone, you may be able to use this by selecting "External mic".</p>

<p><b>History</b></p><pre>

Version 1.9 (2014/03/22)

FIXED   Crash on some devices when starting app or switching camera.

Version 1.8 (2014/03/18)

FIXED   Crash on startup if Network or GPS location providers not available,
        and geotagging was enabled.
FIXED   Crash if specified save folder was an empty string.
FIXED   Don't ever turn on flash during autofocus when app is launched.
FIXED   Various other crashes.
ADDED   Option to not force screen display to maximum brightness.
ADDED   Option to display horizontal "level" line.
ADDED   Support for hardware menu button (now opens settings).
ADDED   Option to display a 4x2 grid (if you previously had a 3x3 "rule of
        thirds" grid, you'll have to reenable it under the Settings).
ADDED   Added privacy policy (for location permission/geotagging) to intro
        window text (needed for Nokia Store).
ADDED   Uses setRecordingHint, may improve performance of starting video
        recording.
ADDED   New About option in Settings, providing debug info.
UPDATED Don't re-autofocus before taking a photo, if camera recently
        successfully focused due to user touching the screen.
UPDATED Display yellow or green dot next to earth icon to indicate location
        accuracy.
UPDATED Display earth icon with red dash through it, if geotagging is enabled,
        but the app doesn't have a location.
UPDATED Current zoom is now saved when app goes idle, or switching cameras.
UPDATED Offset zoom slider slightly so as to not interfere with Google Now
        swipe.
UPDATED Allow greater range of characters (including unicode) for save location
        (now allows any character other than those reserved by filesystem).

Version 1.7 (2014/01/29)

FIXED   More fixes for aspect ratio - the preview display should now always
        have a 1:1 aspect ratio (on some devices this may mean black bars are
        shown, if there isn't a match between the camera's available preview
        sizes, and the aspect ratio of the device's display).
FIXED   Possible crash relating to creating thumbnails.
FIXED   Autofocus on startup didn't always actually focus.
FIXED   If camera doesn't support focus areas, but does support metering areas,
        still set the metering area.
FIXED   Was sometimes trying to set metering areas when metering areas not
        supported by device.
FIXED   If image is deleted after taking the photo, the thumbnail is now
        properly updated to what is now the most recent photo or video.
ADDED   New option to set preview aspect ratio to match the picture/video
        aspect ratio (WYSIWIG).
UPDATED Save folder can now be an absolute path, allowing possibility to save
        on external SD cards (though you need to know what the path is, which
        typically varies depending on device; I am unable to test this, so
        please let me know if it does or doesn't work).
UPDATED Zoom -/+ control now matches the zoom slider orientation.
UPDATED Hide some icons when taking video, as they don't do anything.

Version 1.6 (2014/01/20)

FIXED   Crash when trying to access image or video resolutions in settings, if
        camera didn't offer these settings.
FIXED   Exposure compensation wasn't available on devices if min or max
        exposure compensation level was equal to 0.
FIXED   Aspect ratio problems with the preview on some devices (if you are
        still having problems, please let me know what Android device you are
        using).
FIXED   Aspect ratio problems with the preview on all devices when switching
        the camera.
FIXED   Problem on smaller devices where on-screen text overlapped with take
        photo button; the text is now aligned to above the button on all
        devices.
ADDED   Zoom can now be also controlled via on-screen slider (next to the
        plus/minus zoom buttons).
ADDED   Option for volume keys to control the exposure compensation.
ADDED   Option to display compass direction of camera on-screen (defaults to
        on, disable it in options if you don't like it).
ADDED   Option to choose microphone for recording audio (support for external
        microphones).
UPDATED Exposure compensation is now set via a new button in the on-screen GUI
        (the black and white +/- symbol) instead of the settings. Clicking this
        will bring up a slider and plus/minus buttons to adjust the exposure
        compensation. To get rid of the slider and buttons, either click the
        Exposure button again, or click elsewhere on the screen.
UPDATED Geotagging now stores image compass direction (GPSImgDirection,
        GPSImgDirectionRef).
UPDATED Display degree symbol for displayed on-screen angles.
UPDATED Zoom control is now transparent.
UPDATED Filter applied to sensor for device angle.

Version 1.5 (2014/01/09)

FIXED   Crash on Android 4.4 when launching for first time, or changing the
        save folder (issue with creating the save folder, due to Android no
        longer allowing ANDROID_MEDIA_MOUNTED to be broadcast).
FIXED   Crash if failed to open camera after switching cameras, then user tried
        to zoom.
FIXED   Other potential crashes (NumberFormatException on "es209ra" on startup;
        RuntimeException on Xperia Go when taking photo; RuntimeException on
        "maxx_ax5" when taking photo with face detection).

Version 1.4 (2013/12/16)

FIXED   Calculation for focus areas wasn't right for front facing cameras.
FIXED   Exif data wasn't getting saved if auto-stabilise option was enabled
        (this also meant that on some cameras/focus modes, the orientation
        would have been incorrect).
FIXED   "Toast" pop-up messages looked poor on Android 4.4.
FIXED   Fixed potential crash if taking picture fails.
FIXED   Touch to focus with continuous focus shouldn't show red box.
FIXED   Crash with auto-stabilise for some angles larger than 90 degrees.
FIXED   Crash when rotating device when viewing "Photo and video settings".
FIXED   If device was rotated when app was idle, the UI sometimes showed with
        the incorrect orientation.
ADDED   Images now tagged with current location (optional, off by default). Note
        that Open Camera now requires Location permission, for this feature.
ADDED   Option for face detection.
ADDED   Touch to select focus area also now sets the metering area (used to
        determine exposure).
ADDED   Now displays current time.
ADDED   Option to display a 3x3 grid ("rule of thirds").
ADDED   Now displays flashy thumbnail animation when taking a photo (you can
        disable this in the options under "More camera controls..." if you
        don't like this sort of thing!)
UPDATED Gallery button now displays thumbnail of last image/video taken.
UPDATED Clicking the Gallery button now goes to most recent image/video.
UPDATED Made it easier to see on-screen text when underlying photo preview is
        bright, by drawing a background with the text.

Version 1.3 (2013/11/18)

FIXED   Video files may not have shown up properly in other apps, or over USB,
        until rebooting device.
FIXED   Make sure filenames for images/videos are unique.
ADDED   New burst mode option - take a repeated set of photos at once, or with
        a delay.
ADDED   Option for video resolution.
ADDED   Display battery status on screen.
UPDATED Reorganised settings screen to remove clutter - less commonly used
        options have been moved to sub-screens; "Record audio?" is moved to
        "Photo and video settings..."
UPDATED Only show zoom level (if that option is set) when actually zoomed in.

Version 1.2 (2013/11/09)

FIXED   Crash when launching gallery, if no Gallery app installed on device.
FIXED   Selecting a focus area shouldn't switch to focus mode auto.
FIXED   Focus area wasn't getting reset when it should (e.g., changing focus
        mode or zooming).
FIXED   Fixed potential crash on auto focus.
FIXED   Hide GUI options while taking a photo (otherwise problems can be caused
        by changing options, e.g., changing focus mode).
FIXED   Message for failing to open camera was too wide for portrait view.
ADDED   Option for exposure compensation.
ADDED   Show whether auto focus was successful or not (via red/green rectangle)
        even if focus area not selected.
UPDATED Pause after taking photo now defaults to false.
UPDATED Made "toasts" look nicer.
UPDATED Added simple instructions to the intro window shown on first time
        start-up.

Version 1.1 (2013/10/27)
